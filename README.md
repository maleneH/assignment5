## Cucumber

***Our Cucumber tutorial project is in the hellocucumber folder: https://github.com/maleneH/assignment5/tree/main/hellocucumber***

#### • Extend your booking system with a couple of new features by usingtest-first with Cucumber. Inspiration:

  – It should be possible to create new customers and employees
  – Employees should have “work time”. Bookings can not be created
outside of an employee’s work time. For example, it should be
possible to create a work time block on Monday 23/11-2020 from
08:00 - 16:00 – trying to create a booking from 15:00 - 16:30 should
then fail.


 – Creating a booking with the same employee on overlapping times must fail

 – Creating work time on sunday must fail

***We extended the hello cucumber project with the features, as we had some issues with the database in our booking system from previous hand in.***
